# Sorting Visualizer Tool

## Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a C++ application utilizing the SDL2 library to graphically demonstrate the workings of various sorting algorithms. This tool offers a hands-on approach to understanding sorting algorithms by visualizing their processes in real-time.

## Features

- **Algorithms Included**: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Fixed List Size**: 130 elements.
- **Randomization**: Easily randomize the list before sorting.
- **Visualization**: All algorithms sort in ascending order, with appropriate delays for faster algorithms to ensure clarity.

## Controls

- **0**: Generate a different randomized list.
- **1**: Start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- **2**: Start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- **3**: Start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- **4**: Start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- **5**: Start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- **6**: Start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- **q**: Exit Sorting Visualizer.

> **Note**: Avoid repetitive commands to prevent latency and unexpected behavior. Wait for the current command to complete before issuing a new one.
